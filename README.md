**LocalStorage CRM â€” Hochschule Darmstadt Project**
Developed a lightweight, browser-based CRM system as part of an academic project at Hochschule Darmstadt. The application stores all customer data locally in the browser via Web Storage API (localStorage), eliminating the need for a backend and enabling offline-first usage.

Key Features:

Client Data Management: Create, read, update, and delete customer records entirely in the browser.

Offline Support: Full functionality without internet connectivity, thanks to localStorage persistence.

Search & Filtering: Quickly locate customers using dynamic search and filtering tools.

Simple UI/UX
